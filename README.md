### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Camila Fonseca
#### I am Front-end Developer
My love for the digital and audiovisual world deepened in my professional training as a social communicator through the creation of content and community in social networks, which has led me to find the curiosity and desire to impact the construction of web applications. I like how each project becomes a challenge, a mistake becomes an opportunity, and therefore, how through programming I believe in myself, in my skills, and in my ability to improve the user experience.

Skills:  JS / HTML / CSS / NODE JS
