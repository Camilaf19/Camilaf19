### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Camila Fonseca
#### I am Front-end Developer
My love for the digital and audiovisual world deepened in my professional training as a social communicator, which has led me to find the curiosity and desire to impact the construction of web applications as a Front end developer. 

I love how each project becomes a challenge, a mistake becomes an opportunity to improve, and seek continuous progress and learning of my skills to improve the user experience.
